    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on <b>5 February 1985</b> in the São Pedro parish of Funchal, the capital of the <b>Portuguese island of Madeira</b>,
         and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo António. He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros Aveiro, who worked
          as a cook in the hospitality industry and a cleaning woman, and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener at the Junta de Freguesia of Santo António
           and part-time kit man for football club Andorinha. His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, an African woman, was born in
            the island of São Vicente, in what was then Portuguese Cape Verde, and moved to Madeira Island at 16. He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older
             sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia "Kátia". He was named after actor and U.S. President Ronald Reagan, whom his father was a fan of. His mother revealed
              that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure.
               Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings</p>
