    </ul>
   <p>Ronaldo's move to <b>Manchester United</b> was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the <b>2003–04 season</b>, 
    and made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history  Although he <b>requested the number 28</b>, his number at Sporting,
    <b>he received the squad </b><mark>number 7</mark> shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.
    A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said:
    "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career"<br/><br/>
    Ronaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4–0 home win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August 2003, and received a standing ovation when he came on for Nicky Butt. 
    His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as "undoubtedly the most exciting debut" he had ever seen. Ronaldo scored his <b>first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick</b>
    in a 3–0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November. Three more league goals followed in the second half of the campaign,
    the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received the <b>first red card</b> of his career.

    <p>At the quarter-final stage of the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League, Ronaldo scored his first goals in his 30th match in the competition,[52] scoring twice in a 7–1 win over Roma.
        He subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against Milan, which ended in a 3–2 win,[54] but was marked out of the second leg as United lost 3–0 at the San Siro.
        He also helped United reach the 2007 FA Cup Final, but the final against Chelsea ended in a 1–0 defeat.
        Ronaldo scored the only goal in the Manchester derby on 5 May (his 50th goal for the club). Ronaldo scored his <b>first hat-trick</b> for United in a 6–0 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008, which put United top of the league table.
         On 19 March, <b>he captained United for the first time</b> in a home win over Bolton and scored both goals in a 2–0 win.</p>
